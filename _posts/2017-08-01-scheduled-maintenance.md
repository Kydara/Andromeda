On Monday, October 9, 2017 starting at 16:00 UTC (12:00 EDT), and continuing until 16:30 UTC (30 minutes), Heroku will be performing maintenance on Heroku Connect EU (Dublin region).

During this time, Heroku Connect in the EU Region will not sync data. Customers will continue to be able to use the data already in their database and new changes in their database will continue to be captured. All changes will be synced after Connect service is restored.

Additionally, customers will not be able create new Connect add-ons in the EU region or change the configuration of existing EU region addons.

The Heroku External Objects functionality will not be affected by this maintenance.

We will provide an update when we begin and complete the maintenance.
